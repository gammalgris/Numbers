"There's no sense in being precise when you don't even know what you're talking
about."

 - John von Neumann


Precision in numbers can be a futile goal. Rounding errors and approximations
are inevitable. Numbers may even suggest the illusion of precision.

I dedicate this math exercise to my former math teacher Dr. Martin Haas. He
may not remember all pupils he met during his career but his work was not
futile.
