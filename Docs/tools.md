  Source: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/

* JDeveloper
  Version: 12.2.1.4.0
  Source: see Oracle (https://www.oracle.com/)
  Note: If you use JDeveloper, then you just need to open the workspace file
        and the workspace and all subprojects are openend within the IDE.
		The only thing that remains is to update the JVM in the project
		settings of each subproject.
		You can use any other IDE but then you have to create the workspace
		and include all subprojects. All subprojects contain a text file
		which describe the dependencies.
